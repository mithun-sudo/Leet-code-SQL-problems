-- Table: Points

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | id            | int     |
-- | x_value       | int     |
-- | y_value       | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key for this table.
-- Each point is represented as a 2D Dimensional (x_value, y_value).
-- Write an SQL query to report of all possible rectangles which can be formed by any two points of the table. 

-- Each row in the result contains three columns (p1, p2, area) where:

-- p1 and p2 are the id of two opposite corners of a rectangle and p1 < p2.
-- Area of this rectangle is represented by the column area.
-- Report the query in descending order by area in case of tie in ascending order by p1 and p2.

-- Points table:

-- +----------+-------------+-------------+
-- | 1        | 2           | 8           |
-- | 2        | 4           | 7           |
-- | 3        | 2           | 10          |

-- Result table:
-- +----------+-------------+-------------+
-- | p1       | p2          | area        |
-- +----------+-------------+-------------+
-- | 2        | 3           | 6           |
-- | 1        | 2           | 2           |
-- +----------+-------------+-------------+

-- p1 should be less than p2 and area greater than 0.
-- p1 = 1 and p2 = 2, has an area equal to |2-4| * |8-7| = 2.
-- p1 = 2 and p2 = 3, has an area equal to |4-2| * |7-10| = 6.
-- p1 = 1 and p2 = 3 It's not possible because the rectangle has an area equal to 0.

-- Solution

CREATE TABLE Points (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    x_value INT,
    y_value INT
);

INSERT INTO Points (id, x_value, y_value) VALUES 
(1, 2, 8),
(2, 4, 7),
(3, 2, 10);

select

from
(select
A.id as p1,
B.id as p2,
abs(A.x_value - B.x_value) * abs(A.y_value - B.y_value) as Area
from points A
cross join points B
where A.id < B.id) C
where C.area > 0
